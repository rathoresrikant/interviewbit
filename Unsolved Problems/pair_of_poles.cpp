/*
Pair of poles
Problem Description
There are N poles and height of the poles are given by an integer array A.
You have to connect two poles such that all the poles between them have height smaller than the minimum height of the two poles.

Find the total number of pairs of such poles.

Note: The height of the given poles are distinct.


Problem Constraints
2<=N<=100000
1<=A[i]<=10^9


Input Format
First argument is an integer array A.


Output Format
Return an integer denoting the total number of pairs of such poles.


Example Input
A=[4,3,6,1,10]


Example Output
6


Example Explanation
All the pairs of poles are [4,3],[4,6],[3,6],[6,10],[6,1],[1,10]
